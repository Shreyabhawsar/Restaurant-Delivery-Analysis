**Project: Restaurant Delivery Overview (Pizza Delivery Analysis)**

Short Description :
A data analysis and visualization project that analyzes multi-restaurant pizza delivery data. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are performed using Python (Pandas, NumPy). The final deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes order trends, delivery performance, traffic impact, payment patterns, and customer behavior to drive operational insights.

**Business Problem**
Restaurants face challenges in understanding delivery performance, customer behavior, peak order times, and the impact of traffic on delivery efficiency. Without clear insights, operations may suffer from delays, resource misallocation, lower customer satisfaction, and reduced profitability.

**Dashboard Goal**
The Restaurant Delivery Overview dashboard is created to:
Monitor delivery performance across multiple restaurants.
Identify delays, traffic impact, and operational inefficiencies.
Understand order trends, payment behavior, and customer preferences.
Support data-driven decisions for staffing, routing, and operational improvements.

**Project Overview**
This project analyzes pizza delivery data across multiple restaurants to identify patterns in order volume, delivery times, payment methods, pizza preferences, and the effect of traffic on delivery performance. The analysis helps stakeholders optimize delivery operations and improve customer satisfaction.

**Key Features**
Data cleaning & validation using Python.
Exploratory Data Analysis (aggregations, time series, and distributions).
Visualizations showing order trends, delivery durations, traffic effects, and payment types.
Interactive Power BI dashboard to explore restaurant-wise and zone-wise performance.
Actionable insights and recommendations for operations.

**Key Visuals**

Here are the main visuals included in the dashboard and the reason behind each one:
1. Total Orders, Average Delivery Duration, On‑Time Delivery Rate (KPIs)
Why used: KPIs give a quick snapshot of performance. Decision-makers can instantly understand the current business status.

2. Orders by Restaurant (Bar Chart)
Why used: Bar charts are best for comparing categories. It clearly shows which restaurant receives the most/least orders.

3. Delivery Duration by Traffic Level (Column or Line Chart)
Why used: Helps analyze how traffic affects delivery speed. Identifies bottlenecks and helps optimize delivery routes.

4. Payment Method Distribution (Donut/Pie Chart)
Why used: A pie/donut chart visually shows the share of each payment method. Useful for understanding customer preferences.

5. Orders Over Time (Line Chart)
Why used: Line charts are perfect for time‑based trends (daily/weekly/monthly). Shows peak hours and demand fluctuations.

6. Pizza Type / Category Popularity (Bar Chart)
Why used: Helps restaurants understand which items are most loved and which may need promotion or removal.

7. Restaurant-wise Average Delivery Time (Clustered Bar)
Why used: Helps compare delivery efficiency across restaurants.

8. Zone-wise Orders (Map or Filled Map)
Why used: Geographic visuals highlight demand-heavy zones for staffing and delivery planning.
